# Painting with AI

Using AI to colonize the red planet.

## Summary

This project is about giving some suggestions to optimize the efficiency of the Mars Rover.


## Background

Since the first time that humanity got his feet onto the red planet, there were always a lot of discussions about making a habitant for human being to start colonizing it. The latest efforts were mostly coordinated about using new upgraded AI platforms into new rovers in order to prevent them from getting into obstacles. The key element in this field of studies is the complexity of AI which is using in the lastest rover in order to make it more and more self-confident.



## How is it used?

With AI4Mars, users outline rock and landscape features in images from NASA's Perseverance Mars rover. The project helps train an artificial intelligence algorithm for improved rover c


## Challenges

Future Mars exploration missions will present scientists and astronauts alike with a host of problem that will challenge human survival. Accessing water, dealing with a frigid planet that lacks oxygen and coping with dangerous levels of radiation are among the biggest hurdles to overcome.
